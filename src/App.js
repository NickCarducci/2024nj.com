        "With poverty defined as the bottom 20% of earners, how can you
        eliminate poverty, since there’s always a bottom 20%?"
        <br />
        You are describing income inequality, not poverty with numeration as
        inflation
        <br />
        <br />
        Food Clothing Shelter Utilities (FCSU) * 1.2 for the employee
        contribution constant with imputed mortgages; unpoverty threshold used
        to be thrice food, income.
        <br />
        <br />
        A percentile of an absolute (income), rather than a ratio (poverty), is
        skewed by concentration-of-presentation, alone; however, poverty
        thresholds flatten percentile of a ratio to a distribution, forged by
        despondency from said threshold. The base calculation uses a third of
        income on FCSU.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can end poverty by adjudicating contract law over surrendered
        freedoms so 1/hour-GDP/p is maximized as labor is variable part of
        sprints with material, and we can lessen income despondency.

        Why does the division of labor increase the economy's level of
        production?
        <br />
        If production is 1/hour-GDP/p:
        <br />
        <br />
        Competition, by 1/12 industry-vertical, provides for inelasticity by
        1/hour-GDP/p efficiency (0y/1x), of even the most elastic markets,
        where:
        <br />
        <br />
        price is no matter to the ordered by propensity of
        ask-inventory-opportunity-cost of Labor-Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not only does the division of labor necessarily provide, unto,
        substitutive-vertical lines of production, it also, does so, by
        complementary-horizontal designs of life, or living costs. Short answer:
        skill-sharing (a.k.a. “comparative advantage”). The delegation of labor
        does not increase consumption/expenditures/income, it only increases
        efficiency and equates Supply with Labor-Demand, along the 1/hour-GDP/p
        plane, which, in fact, should decrease price (y).

        Leading cause of death under communism is starvation, which was the

        <br />
        <br />
        "Supply is low, prices rise - it is just Supply and Demand," well supply
        is material and labor, price and hour.
        <br />
        <br />
        <hr ref={this.supply} />
        The snapshot of the Supply and Demand plane has no representation of
        physical resource supply, just potential trade for hours, 1/hour-GDP/p,
        unless relative. If relative to another point in time, it is a leftward
        movement of ordered-propensities to meet MUI by
        ask-bid-inventory-opportunity, for this, or other markets, in which
        lower Supply makes Demand average utility cost traded, higher, less
        traded - not raise price when Supply is in a loward-shift - price is an
        effect of trade and propensities. Yet, if Demand is elastic, all Demand
        consumes at the scarce price, and yet-still-for competiton will
        lowardly-shift, even perfectly-elastic Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leftward supply is matched by demand when scarcity breeds competition,
        and a drop in price does so for both. A leftward shift in supply
        propensities may be for a substitute fungible-currency-bid becoming
        cheaper or a compliment fungible-currency-bid becoming expensive (when
        both, elastic, weak is no relation for inventory bid nor opportunity
        cost).
        <br />

        (Russia has $20 oil, it is supply and demand) yet all of Supply and
        Demand is labor as well.
