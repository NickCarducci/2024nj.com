        <br />
        Alexandra Engle - Go read Adam Smith. He defined it before Marx and in
        this instance of surplus profit [division of labor - comparative
        advantage - skills trading - nationalistic-retardation], Marx's ideals
        and theory fail miserably in application. No communist country has ever
        increased the wages of the state employees because they profited more.
        They shoved it in their pockets and made a very select few rich.
        <br />
        Nick Carducci - Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate
        the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power
        to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Alexandra Engle - Exactly my point. Marx's idea failed. The USSR meant
        that Stalin and a select few subjugated everyone else's labor. In North
        Korea, not a select few but a family, more dynasty than Marx's concept.
        China? Ditto until they decided to open up their economy to the global
        economy, and even then Jack Ma paid the price of flying too high.
        <br />
        Thanks for quoting only to prove my point.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nick Carducci - Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the
        democrats) has taken over distribution as production[, not
        productive-ward]. After the real relation has long been made clear, why
        retrogress again?

        If you need your savings, don’t feel compelled to pay the consumer debt,
        nor firesale your assets. Regardless, debts are tortious for standing by
        the borrower for force majeure ($12k/64 new debt/cash U.S. per person)
        and third party donee beneficiaries whom actually have the cash
        promised, and will be reversed by (cash/debt)*income that will be the
        last before 1/12 industry-vertical as “collateral” max-royalty to become
        subservient to customers of labor-borne-demand.

        “Tortious,” means you can sue for “force majeure,” that means
        foreseeable impossible intent. After “reverse” amortization, future
        debts will be organized in a way that disburses return to the business
        account by 1/12 NAICS industry designation, for “standing” or the
        ability to sue on “laundering grounds,” or dodging max-royalty, which is
        an “operational rate” as opposed to time-based, so that you await
        customers instead of take credit as income.

        Mind you, I am a developer for bookkeeping software, that believes a
        transaction-fee based currency is the future - now that USD is fungible
        for treasury inventory (at least 23% of oil-wells in America are
        “federally-leased” back to us through corporations instead of dollar
        royalty and drilling sign off, to be subservient to customers). Debt is
        the cause of inflation, that is the rationale that the Federal Reserve
        provides for raising rates. Why do that pennywise short for a pound
        cowardice? Just work for demand in real time without a money ‘market’ by
        “collateral” as NAICS industry-designations as tortious for revenue for
        max-royalty, undisbursed.

        "With poverty defined as the bottom 20% of earners, how can you
        eliminate poverty, since there’s always a bottom 20%?"
        <br />
        You are describing income inequality, not poverty with numeration as
        inflation
        <br />
        <br />

        contribution constant with imputed mortgages; unpoverty threshold used
        to be thrice food, income.
        <br />
        <br />
        A percentile of an absolute (income), rather than a ratio (poverty), is
        skewed by concentration-of-presentation, alone; however, poverty
        thresholds flatten percentile of a ratio to a distribution, forged by
        despondency from said threshold. The base calculation uses a third of
        income on FCSU.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can end poverty by adjudicating contract law over surrendered
        freedoms so 1/hour-GDP/p is maximized as labor is variable part of
        sprints with material, and we can lessen income despondency.

        Why does the division of labor increase the economy's level of
        production?
        <br />
        If production is 1/hour-GDP/p:
        <br />
        <br />
        Competition, by 1/12 industry-vertical, provides for inelasticity by
        1/hour-GDP/p efficiency (0y/1x), of even the most elastic markets,
        where:
        <br />
        <br />
        price is no matter to the ordered by propensity of
        ask-inventory-opportunity-cost of Labor-Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not only does the division of labor necessarily provide, unto,
        substitutive-vertical lines of production, it also, does so, by
        complementary-horizontal designs of life, or living costs. Short answer:
        skill-sharing (a.k.a. “comparative advantage”). The delegation of labor
        does not increase consumption/expenditures/income, it only increases
        efficiency and equates Supply with Labor-Demand, along the 1/hour-GDP/p
        plane, which, in fact, should decrease price (y).

        "Why does the division of labor increase the economy's level of
        production?"
        <br />
        If production is 1/hour-GDP/p:
        <br />
        <br />
        Competition, by 1/12 industry-vertical, provides for inelasticity by
        1/hour-GDP/p efficiency (0y/1x), of even the most elastic markets,
        where:
        <div
          style={{
            borderLeft: "3px solid",
            paddingLeft: "5px"
          }}
        >
          price is no matter to the ordered by propensity of
          ask-inventory-opportunity-cost of Labor-Demand.
        </div>
        <br />
        Not only does the division of labor necessarily provide, unto,
        substitutive-vertical lines of production, it also, does so, by
        complementary-horizontal designs of life, or living costs. Short answer:
        skill-sharing (a.k.a. “comparative advantage”). The delegation of labor
        does not increase consumption/expenditures/income, it only increases
        efficiency and equates Supply with Labor-Demand, along the 1/hour-GDP/p
        plane, which, in fact, should decrease price (y).
        <br />
        <br />
        Leading cause of death under communism is starvation, which was the
        cause before and after the old age growth bumps.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Supply is low, prices rise - it is just Supply and Demand," well supply
        is material and labor, price and hour.
        <br />

        <span style={{ color: "green" }}>1/hour-GDP/p</span>, unless relative.
        If relative to another point in time, it is a (1y/-1x) leftward movement
        of ordered-propensities to meet MUI by ask-bid-inventory-opportunity,
        for this, or other markets, in which lower Supply makes Demand average
        utility cost traded, higher, less traded - not raise price when Supply
        is in a (1y/-1x) loward-shift - price is an effect of trade and
        propensities. Yet, if Demand is elastic, all Demand consumes at the
        scarce price, and yet-still-for competiton will (1y/-1x) lowardly-shift,
        even perfectly-elastic Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leftward (1y/-1x) supply is matched by demand when scarcity breeds

        , and a drop in price does so for both. A leftward shift in supply
        propensities may be for a substitute fungible-currency-bid becoming
        cheaper or a compliment fungible-currency-bid becoming expensive (when
        both, elastic, weak is no relation for inventory bid nor opportunity
        cost).
        <br />
        <br />
        (Russia has $20 oil, it is supply and demand) yet all of Supply and
        Demand is labor as well.
