        All inflation is because of free rider mutable tax (including
        spectrum/pipelines/bridges, Matt Comer) and debt spending (2/3 is
        private, Matt Comer), and crowding out is only when labor is dispondent
        with demand, as 0%/yr+ GDP/p amidst 3%/yr+ population has happened for
        centuries.

        Why does the division of labor increase the economy's level of
        production?
        <br />
        If production is 1/hour-GDP/p:
        <br />
        <br />
        Competition, by 1/12 industry-vertical, provides for inelasticity by
        1/hour-GDP/p efficiency (0y/1x), of even the most elastic markets,
        where:
        <br />
        <br />
        price is no matter to the ordered by propensity of
        ask-inventory-opportunity-cost of Labor-Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Not only does the division of labor necessarily provide, unto,
        substitutive-vertical lines of production, it also, does so, by
        complementary-horizontal designs of life, or living costs. Short answer:
        skill-sharing (a.k.a. ‚Äúcomparative advantage‚Äù). The delegation of labor
        does not increase consumption/expenditures/income, it only increases
        efficiency and equates Supply with Labor-Demand, along the 1/hour-GDP/p
        plane, which, in fact, should decrease price (y).

        is in a (1y/-1x) loward-shift - price is an effect of trade and
